📚 Python Data Structures
Welcome to the Python Data Structures repository! This guide will walk you through the fundamental data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each of these structures is crucial for efficient coding and data manipulation in Python.

📖 Dictionaries
🗂 Sets
📋 Lists
A list is a collection of ordered and changeable elements. Lists are defined by placing the elements inside square brackets [].

python
Copy code
# Example of a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
Key Features:
✅ Ordered
🔄 Changeable
🔢 Allows duplicate elements
🔗 Tuples
A tuple is a collection of ordered and unchangeable elements. Tuples are defined by placing the elements inside parentheses ().

python
Copy code
# Example of a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
Key Features:
✅ Ordered
❌ Unchangeable (Immutable)
🔢 Allows duplicate elements
📖 Dictionaries
A dictionary is a collection of unordered, changeable, and indexed elements. Dictionaries are defined by placing elements in curly brackets {}, with keys and values.

python
Copy code
# Example of a dictionary
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'grade': 'A'}
Key Features:
🔑 Key-Value pairs
❌ Unordered (As of Python 3.7+, insertion order is preserved)
🔄 Changeable
🚫 Does not allow duplicate keys
🗂 Sets
A set is a collection of unordered and unindexed elements. Sets are defined by placing elements inside curly brackets {}.

python
Copy code
# Example of a set
colors = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}
Key Features:
❌ Unordered
❌ Unindexed
🛡️ No duplicate elements
